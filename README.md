# Using the tripadvisor dataset which is based on peoples traveling behaviour we aim at comparing key clustering algorithms with the aim of finding an optimal value that can be adopted in tourism domain and
simultanously recommending most highly rated place to visit.
The tripadvisor dataset is avalible on the public domain which we have used and applied the clustering techiniques line kmeans and Agglomerative.
For this project we found LDA model giving a good accuracy 0.94 accuracy with precision being 0.97 and recall of 0.90. The randon forest was quite overfitting with 
0.99 accuracy considering this being a small dataset and model overlearning. However PCA, Kernal-PCA did not improve the model performance here
