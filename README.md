The tripadvisor dataset is avalible on the public domain which we have used and applied the clustering techiniques line kmeans and Agglomerative.
For this project we found LDA model giving a good accuracy 0.94 accuracy with precision being 0.97 and recall of 0.90. The randon forest was quite overfitting with 
0.99 accuracy considering this being a small dataset and model overlearning. However PCA, Kernal-PCA did not improve the model performance here
